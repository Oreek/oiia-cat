                <h2>Who is Oiia Cat?</h2>
                <p>Oiia Cat is the divine constellation of peace and nonchalantness. With a single paw, she can reshape reality itself. Many have tried to pet her after her origins as a meme... but only a few have succeeded.</p>

                <h2>Irrelevant: DVD Player</h2>
                <p>Kind of irrelevant to the theme but I ran out of ideas so I pretty much though of including a cube to mimic the effect of a DVD player screensaver which I like.</p>

                <h2>Prequel: The Illuminati</h2>
                <p>The Illuminati is often shrouded in mystery, a secret society rumored to influence world events from the shadows. While many dismiss it as a conspiracy theory, others believe it holds the key to hidden knowledge and ultimate power. Our cult believes that Our God - Oiia Cat recieved her powers through the Illuminati and Hence we could also be called the successors of this legacy.</p></div>
